# üëÆ AWS Security - Incident Response: Automatically Quarantine Compromised EC2 Instance

  Lets isolate that errant instance[s], IAM Roles and dump it for analysis using `AWS GuardDuty`, `AWS EventBridge` and `StepFunctions`

  Follow this article in **[Udemy][101]**

1. ## üß∞ Prerequisites

    This demo, instructions, scripts and cloudformation template is designed to be run in `us-east-1`. With few modifications you can try it out in other regions as well(_Not covered here_).

    - AWS CLI pre-configured - [Get help here](https://youtu.be/TPyyfmQte0U)
    - GuardDuty Enabled in the same region - [Get help here](https://youtu.be/ybh_556IMpk)

    _**Note**: Make sure the region is same for AWS CLI and GuardDuty, We will use the same region to deploy our stacks._

1. ## Clone the repository

    Lets clone the repo locally to customize it to suit your needs.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/miztiik/security-incident-response-instance-isolation.git
    cd security-incident-response-instance-isolation
    ```

1. ## Customize the deployment

    Edit the `./helper_scripts/deploy.sh` to update your environment variables.

    _**Note**: Use the same region you have configured your AWS CLI and GuardDuty for your `AWS_REGION`_
  
    ```bash
    AWS_PROFILE="default"
    AWS_REGION="us-east-1"
    BUCKET_NAME="sam-templates-011" # bucket must exist in the SAME region the deployment is taking place
    SERVICE_NAME="Miztiik-Incident-Response"
    TEMPLATE_NAME="incident_response.yaml" # The CF Template should be the same name, If not update it.
    STACK_NAME="incidentResponse"
    TEMPLATE_DIR="./templates"
    OUTPUT_DIR="./outputs"
    PACKAGED_OUTPUT_TEMPLATE="${TEMPLATE_DIR}/${OUTPUT_DIR}/${STACK_NAME}-packaged-template.yaml"
    info_sec_ops_mail="youremail@gmail.com"
    ```

1. ## üöÄ Deployment

    We will use the `deploy.sh` in the `helper_scripts` directory to deploy our [AWS SAM](https://github.com/awslabs/serverless-application-model) template

    ```bash
    chmod +x ./helper_scripts/deploy.sh
    ./helper_scripts/deploy.sh
    ```
  
1. ## üî¨ Testing the solution

    Let us deploy the EC2 instance with an IAM role, that will be simulated as a compromised instance, If we use EC2 instance role credentials outside of it, this should trigger an GuardDuty finding.

    ```bash
    aws cloudformation deploy \
        --template-file ./templates/compromised_instance.yaml \
        --stack-name "compromised-instance" \
        --capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM
    ```

    - Connect to EC2 instance and execute the following command. You will receive an access key, secret key and token.

    ```bash
    sudo yum -y install jq
    role_name=$(curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/)
    session=$(curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/$role_name)
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="$(echo $session | jq -r .AccessKeyId)"
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="$(echo $session | jq -r .SecretAccessKey)"
    AWS_SESSION_TOKEN="$(echo $session | jq -r .Token)"
    echo -e "###########-SECRETS-#############"
    echo -e $session
    ```

    Output looks like,

    ```bash
    {
        "Code" : "Success",
        "LastUpdated" : "2019-12-22T16:42:46Z",
        "Type" : "AWS-HMAC",
        "AccessKeyId" : "ASOMEWXJQGSZO4CXB",
        "SecretAccessKey" : "HRStonegkFUIfIQBcMYKon6CW9fcuk4/m3",
        "Token" : "IQoJb3JpZ2luX.......SOMETHING....HERE..............TkDA==",
        "Expiration" : "2019-12-22T23:17:44Z"
    }
    ```

    - Open a local terminal,(Maybe another EC2 instance).
    From the prevous output, replace the values for these, and run them,
    _**Note**: Make sure the token does not have line breaks_

    ```bash
    export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="YOUR-ACCESS-KEY"
    export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="YOUR-SECRET-KEY"
    export AWS_SESSION_TOKEN="YOUR-TOKEN"
    ```

    - Lets check if we can query S3 with these new credentials,

    ```bash
    aws sts get-caller-identity
    aws s3 ls
    unset AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
    unset AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
    unset AWS_SESSION_TOKEN
    aws sts get-caller-identity
    date
    ```

1. ## Verify the Security Breach

    _**Note**: Typically, it takes about ~20 to 30 minutes for GuardDuty to raise a finding. Within 5 Minutes of a finding, A CloudWatch Event is triggered._

    - Check the `GuardDuty` service page for any new findings.

    - Check the StateMachine Execution

      The following actions should have taken place,

      1. An new security group added to the EC2 Instance
      1. An snapshot of the EC2 instance created
      1. An `DenyAll` policy attached to the IAM Role, attached to the EC2 Instance.

    Now that we have confirmed the solution is working, you can extend the solution as required.

1. ## Next Steps: Do Try This

    There are SNS notification resources, pre-baked in this solution. Go ahead and finish the configuration so you can get notified about findings.

1. ## üßπ CleanUp

    If you want to destroy all the resources created by the stack, Execute the below command to delete the stack, or _you can delete the stack from console as well_

    1. Disable/Suspend GuardDuty as required
    1. Delete QUARANTINE EBS Snapshots
    1. Delete QUARANTINE Security Group
    1. Delete QUARANTINE Deny all policy
    1. Delete the stack[s],

    ```bash
    # Delete the CF Stack
    ./helper_scripts/deploy.sh nuke
    aws cloudformation delete-stack \
        --stack-name "compromised-instance" \
        --region "${AWS_REGION}"
    ```
